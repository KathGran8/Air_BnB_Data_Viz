    "#### What is your dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main dataset stores information about the Airbnb activity in New York in 2019. Its initial size is contains approximately 50,000 Airbnb listings with plenty of information about each of them such as the host name, the place location and its room type and number of reveiws, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional information is comprised in three datasets:\n",
    "- [Tree Census in New York City](https://www.kaggle.com/nycparks/tree-census)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This dataset stores a record for every publicly owned tree in New York City and includes each of the  tree's location by borough and latitude/longitude, species, size, health, and more. Three census from 2015, 2005, and 1995 were conducted by NYC Parks and Recreation staff, TreesCount! program staff, and hundreds of volunteers. We chose the one from 2015, with almost 700,000 entries, since it is the closest in time to the records of our main Airbnb dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [NYC Rat Sightings](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-rat-sightings)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This dataset contains information about the rat sightings in New York. Data is from 2010-Sept 16th, 2017 and includes date, location (lat/lon), type of structure, borough, and community board. We filtered the dataset and chose only the reports from 2017, narrowing it down to approximately 15,000 rat sightings.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- [348 New York Tourist Locations](https://www.kaggle.com/anirudhmunnangi/348-new-york-tourist-locations)\n",
    "    This dataset gathers information about 348 tourist places in New York. It only has the name, addres and zipcode of the place, but we will figure out a way of translating this into latitude and longitude coordinates to perform our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "#### What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "#### What is the idea?\n",
    "#### Why is it interesting?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Basic stats. Let's understand the dataset better\n",
    "#### Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
    "#### Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.\n",
    " \n",
    "## 3. Data Analysis\n",
    "### Describe your data analysis and explain what you've learned about the dataset.\n",
    "### If relevant, talk about your machine-learning.\n",
    " \n",
    "## 4.Genre. Which genre of data story did you use?\n",

    "#### Explain the visualizations you've chosen.\n",
    "#### Why are they right for the story you want to tell?\n",
    " \n",
    "## 6. Discussion. Think critically about your creation\n",
    "#### What went well?,\n",
    "#### What is still missing? What could be improved?, Why?\n",
    " \n",
    "## 7. Contributions. Who did what?\n",
    "#### You should write (just briefly) which group member was the main responsible for which elements of the assignment. (I want you guys to understand every part of the assignment, but usually there is someone who took lead role on certain portions of the work. That's what you should explain). It is not OK simply to write \"All group members contributed equally\".\n",
